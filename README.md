# Krabligraphy ðŸ¦€

This is a rather silly crate that is intended for generating text that you can paste into
Discord for fun.

### Why's it called 'Krabligraphy'? ðŸ¦€

It's an inside joke on one of the discord servers that I'm in.

### How do you use it? ðŸ¦€

I built this with `wl-copy` in mind. So the intended use is as follows:

```
$ krabligraphy [option] "Text to work on" | wl-copy
```

Then you can just paste it into discord.
